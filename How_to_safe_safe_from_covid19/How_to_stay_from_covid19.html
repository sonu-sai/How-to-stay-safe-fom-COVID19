    <h1>How to stafe from COVID19</h1>
    <h4>“Prevention is better than cure”</h4>
    <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as </br>
        Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).</p>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.</p>
    <p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted </br>
        from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans</p>
    <p>COVID-19 is a newly identified respiratory virus that can easily spread.It shares several symptoms with influenza, but it’s treated differently.</br>
         COVID-19 infection may appear two to 14 days after exposure and can include fever, cough and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</p>
